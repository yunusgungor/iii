//! Engine-death cascade behaviors NOT covered by
//! `daemon_orphan_exit_integration.rs` (which pins the basic exit paths:
//! reparent fallback, lifeline EOF, engine-pid handshake, signals).
//!
//! This file pins the layered semantics on top of those paths:
//!
//! - the durable **breadcrumb** in `~/.iii/logs/<daemon>.log` is written on
//!   engine-gone exits (with the right fields) and ONLY on engine-gone exits
//!   — a breadcrumb on every graceful shutdown was a real pre-fix bug;
//! - **precedence**: lifeline EOF is authoritative even while the declared
//!   engine pid is alive, and the pid backstop pins the ENGINE pid over the
//!   spawner pid when both are declared;
//! - the **spawner-pid backstop** covers the one lifeline failure mode (a
//!   leaked write end keeping EOF at bay — the macOS no-`pipe2` race);
//! - garbage `III_ENGINE_PID` degrades to the reparent fallback instead of
//!   crashing or arming a bogus watch;
//! - the session reaper actually KILLS a running worker process (the log-line
//!   test in the sibling file only proves the reaper ran);
//! - `sandbox-daemon` (the second armed daemon) exits on engine death too.
//!
//! Every daemon gets `HOME=<tempdir>` (breadcrumbs and pidfiles are read
//! under `$HOME/.iii`) and `current_dir(<tempdir>)` (worker discovery reads
//! `./config.yaml` relative to the daemon's cwd), so tests can neither see
//! nor touch the developer's real workers.

/// layer's internal-error `eprintln!` fallback panics on the equally-broken
/// stderr, and the main task unwinds BEFORE the breadcrumb and the reaper —
/// silent exit 101, nothing reaped. The fix re-points fds 1/2 at the
/// durable exit log the instant engine death is detected, which also makes
/// the reap pass visible there. File-backed stdio (every other test in
